1. Create a virtual environment that we will use to install the library of python
   a. python -m venv venv               #Create a virtual environment
   b. venv/scripts/activate             #Activate the virtual environment
2. Create requirements.txt file         #Inside this file we keep on the library in this file
3. Create main.py file                  #It's an entry point of your application
4. app folder                           # Inside this folder we keep app related files (Init Rest API roots)
5. services folder                      # Inside this folder we keep the logic of services (logic of API)
6. routers folder                       # Inside this folder we keep the routs (api)       (requests/endpoints)            
7. Using the fastAPI framework we will create the endpoint in python
8. Install the library of python using "pip install -r requirement.txt"
9. To convert any fuction into API we will use decorator (@app.get("/test"))
10. After adding the details in main.py file, now open https://127.0.0.1/testAPI url in browser and see the message.
11. If you want to see the doc of api you can open "http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" 
12. If you want to add readme of your api documenttation you can put "redoc_url=/" in your app.ay file
13. if else in different way
      """
    if cpu_percent > cpu_threshold
        status = "High CPU"
    else
        status = "Healthy"
    """
    status = "High CPU" if cpu_percent > cpu_threshold else "Healthy"
14. If you want to add the exceptions in your code you can import the HTTPException class from fastAPI
15. You have created router, login. Now We have to initialise the, Need to register router in app.
16. Now, We will add the aws service in project
17. If you want to add any prefix to router you can inside api.py file in "app.include_router(aws.router, prefix="/aws")"
18.
